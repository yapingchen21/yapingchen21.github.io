abstract: "Former studies have established that individuals with a cochlear implant (CI) for treating single-sided deafness experience improved speech processing after implantation. However, it is not clear how each ear contributes separately to improve speech perception over time at the behavioural and neural level. In this longitudinal EEG study with four different time points, we measured neural activity in response to various temporally and spectrally degraded spoken words presented monaurally to the CI and non-CI ears (5 left and 5 right ears) in 10 single-sided CI users and 10 age- and sex-matched individuals with normal hearing. Subjective comprehension ratings for each word were also recorded. Data from single-sided CI participants were collected pre-CI implantation, and at 3, 6 and 12 months after implantation. We conducted a time-resolved representational similarity analysis on the EEG data to quantify whether and how neural patterns became more similar to those of normal hearing individuals. At 6 months after implantation, the speech comprehension ratings for the degraded words improved in both ears. Notably, the improvement was more pronounced for the non-CI ears than the CI ears. Furthermore, the enhancement in the non-CI ears was paralleled by increased similarity to neural representational patterns of the normal hearing control group. The maximum of this effect coincided with peak decoding accuracy for spoken-word comprehension (600-1200 ms after stimulus onset). The present data demonstrate that cortical processing gradually normalizes within months after CI implantation for speech presented to the non-CI ear. CI enables the deaf ear to provide afferent input, which, according to our results, complements the input of the non-CI ear, gradually improving its function. These novel findings underscore the feasibility of tracking neural recovery after auditory input restoration using advanced multivariate analysis methods, such as representational similarity analysis."
