Synchronization of neural activity with these modulations supports speech comprehension. As the acoustic modulation of speech is related to the production of syllables, investigations of neural speech tracking commonly do not distinguish between lower-level acoustic (envelope modulation) and higher-level linguistic (syllable rate) information. Here we manipulated speech intelligibility using noise-vocoded speech and investigated the spectral dynamics of neural speech processing, across two studies at cortical and subcortical levels of the auditory hierarchy, using magnetoencephalography. Overall, cortical regions mostly track the syllable rate, whereas subcortical regions track the acoustic envelope. Furthermore, with less intelligible speech, tracking of the modulation rate becomes more dominant. Our study highlights the importance of distinguishing between envelope modulation and syllable rate and provides novel possibilities to better understand differences between auditory processing and speech/language processing disorders.","tags":["Vocoded speech","Temporal response function","Coherence","FOOOF","MEG"],"title":"Neural speech tracking shifts from the syllabic to the modulation rate of speech as intelligibility decreases","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ya-Ping CHEN","Fabian Schmidt","Anne Keitel","Sebastian Rösch","Anne Hauswald","Nathan Weisz"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1674259200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1674259200,"objectID":"9941643dc22e5ff66ee539b8755897bd","permalink":"https://yapingchen21.github.io/publication/2023_chen_neuroimage/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2023_chen_neuroimage/","section":"publication","summary":"Listening to speech with poor signal quality is challenging. Neural speech tracking of degraded speech has been used to advance the understanding of how brain processes and speech intelligibility are interrelated. However, the temporal dynamics of neural speech tracking and their relation to speech intelligibility are not clear. In the present MEG study, we exploited temporal response functions (TRFs), which has been used to describe the time course of speech tracking on a gradient from intelligible to unintelligible degraded speech. In addition, we used inter-related facets of neural speech tracking (e.g., speech envelope reconstruction, speech-brain coherence, and components of broadband coherence spectra) to endorse our findings in TRFs. Our TRF analysis yielded marked temporally differential effects of vocoding: ∼50–110 ms (M50TRF), ∼175–230 ms (M200TRF), and ∼315–380 ms (M350TRF). Reduction of intelligibility went along with large increases of early peak responses M50TRF, but strongly reduced responses in M200TRF. In the late responses M350TRF, the maximum response occurred for degraded speech that was still comprehensible then declined with reduced intelligibility. Furthermore, we related the TRF components to our other neural “tracking“ measures and found that M50TRF and M200TRF play a differential role in the shifting center frequency of the broadband coherence spectra. Overall, our study highlights the importance of time-resolved computation of neural speech tracking and decomposition of coherence spectra and provides a better understanding of degraded speech processing.","tags":["Vocoded speech","Temporal response function","Coherence","FOOOF","MEG"],"title":"Speech intelligibility changes the temporal evolution of neural speech tracking","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1671379200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1671379200,"objectID":"55187726235c9aed0614f673a06ec44e","permalink":"https://yapingchen21.github.io/presentation/2022_taipei/","publishdate":"2021-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/presentation/2022_taipei/","section":"presentation","summary":"University System of Taiwan, Taipei, Taiwan","tags":[],"title":"Invited Talk - How do human beings process degraded speech?","type":"presentation"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1669132800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1669132800,"objectID":"4245e4599dc1177c7d33251b69235334","permalink":"https://yapingchen21.github.io/presentation/2022_toronto/","publishdate":"2021-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/presentation/2022_toronto/","section":"presentation","summary":"Toronto Auditory Research Group, Toronto, Canada","tags":[],"title":"Invited Talk - How do human beings process degraded speech?","type":"presentation"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1668506400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1668506400,"objectID":"903c08300e2abf9da7d3483435c42969","permalink":"https://yapingchen21.github.io/presentation/2022_sfn/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/presentation/2022_sfn/","section":"presentation","summary":"Society for Neuroscience Annual Meeting (SfN), San Diego, USA","tags":[],"title":"Poster - Speech intelligibility changes the temporal evolution of neural speech tracking","type":"presentation"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1668168000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1668168000,"objectID":"5bfa10dcf299bf4cb091aa431bd803a3","permalink":"https://yapingchen21.github.io/presentation/2022_apan/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/presentation/2022_apan/","section":"presentation","summary":"Advances and Perspectives in Auditory Neuroscience (APAN), San Diego, USA","tags":[],"title":"Poster - Cochlear implantation for sigle-sided deafness improves speech perception in both CI and non-CI ears: A longitudinal EEG study","type":"presentation"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1605096000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1605096000,"objectID":"9fece2c7665709cb4a285f92ace91d22","permalink":"https://yapingchen21.github.io/presentation/2020_apan/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/presentation/2020_apan/","section":"presentation","summary":"Advances and Perspectives in Auditory Neuroscience (APAN), virtual","tags":[],"title":"Poster - Neural temporal dynamics of continuous degraded speech processing","type":"presentation"},{"authors":["Anne Hauswald","Anne Keitel","Ya-Ping CHEN","Sebastian Rösch","Nathan Weisz"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1595217600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1595217600,"objectID":"0bb59159ebd823ca99f999a54b8a8c6f","permalink":"https://yapingchen21.github.io/publication/2022_hauswald_ejn/","publishdate":"2020-07-20T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2022_hauswald_ejn/","section":"publication","summary":"Making sense of a poor auditory signal can pose a challenge. Previous attempts to quantify speech intelligibility in neural terms have usually focused on one of two measures, namely low-frequency speech-brain synchronization or alpha power modulations. However, reports have been mixed concerning the modulation of these measures, an issue aggravated by the fact that they have normally been studied separately. We present two MEG studies analyzing both measures. In study 1, participants listened to unimodal auditory speech with three different levels of degradation (original, 7-channel and 3-channel vocoding). Intelligibility declined with declining clarity, but speech was still intelligible to some extent even for the lowest clarity level (3-channel vocoding). Low-frequency (1–7 Hz) speech tracking suggested a U-shaped relationship with strongest effects for the medium-degraded speech (7-channel) in bilateral auditory and left frontal regions. To follow up on this finding, we implemented three additional vocoding levels (5-channel, 2-channel and 1-channel) in a second MEG study. Using this wider range of degradation, the speech-brain synchronization showed a similar pattern as in study 1, but further showed that when speech becomes unintelligible, synchronization declines again. The relationship differed for alpha power, which continued to decrease across vocoding levels reaching a floor effect for 5-channel vocoding. Predicting subjective intelligibility based on models either combining both measures or each measure alone showed superiority of the combined model. Our findings underline that speech tracking and alpha power are modified differently by the degree of degradation of continuous speech but together contribute to the subjective speech understanding.","tags":["degraded speech","continuous speech","alpha power","coherence","MEG"],"title":"Degradation levels of continuous speech affect neural speech tracking and alpha power differently","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1560012300,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560012300,"objectID":"0bb5486a4c8bde4492135fdcf391d350","permalink":"https://yapingchen21.github.io/presentation/2019_ohbm/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/presentation/2019_ohbm/","section":"presentation","summary":"Organization for Human Brain Mapping (OHBM), Rome, Italy","tags":[],"title":"Poster - Retrospective searching for feature binding of color and letter from within visual working memory representations","type":"presentation"},{"authors":["Yang-Teng Fan","Ya-Wen Fang","Ya-Ping CHEN","Eric D Leshikar","Ching-Po Lin","Ovid JL Tzeng","Hsu-Wen Huang","Chih-Mao Huang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"cac5a065ba09a5b8b0cdf83c13716807","permalink":"https://yapingchen21.github.io/publication/2019_fan_agingmentalhealth/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019_fan_agingmentalhealth/","section":"publication","summary":"Alterations in brain structure are viewed as neurobiological indicators which are closely tied to cognitive changes in healthy human aging. The current study used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography to investigate the relationship between age, brain variation in white matter (WM) integrity, and cognitive function. Sixteen younger adults (aged 20–28 years) and 18 healthy older adults (aged 60–75 years) underwent DTI scanning and a standardized battery of neuropsychological measures. Behaviorally, older adults exhibited poorer performance on multiple cognitive measures compared to younger adults. At the neural level, the effects of aging on theWM integrity were evident within interhemispheric (the anterior portion of corpus callosum) and transverse (the right uncinate fasciculus) fibers of the frontal regions, and the cingulum-angular fibers. Our correlation results showed that age-related WM differentially influenced cognitive function, with increased fractional anisotropy values in both the anterior corpus callosum and the right cingulum/angular fibers positively correlated with performance on the visuospatial task in older adults. Moreover, mediation analysis further revealed that the WM tract integrity of the frontal interhemspheric fibers was a significant mediator of age–visuospatial performance relation in older adults, but not in younger adults. These findings support the vulnerability of the frontal WM fibers to normal aging and push forward our understanding of cognitive aging by providing a more integrative view of the neural basis of linkages among aging, cognition, and brain.","tags":["Brain aging","cognition","diffusion tensor imaging","frontal interhemispheric fibers","visuospatial ability"],"title":"Aging, cognition, and the brain: effects of age-related variation in white matter integrity on neuropsychological function","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Feng-Tzu Chen","Ya-Ping CHEN","Stefan Schneider","Shih-Chun Kao","Chih-Mao Huang","Yu-Kai Chang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"fe86c7d4dd4a0231c2d9edb56c06f082","permalink":"https://yapingchen21.github.io/publication/2019_chenft_frontagingneurosci/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019_chenft_frontagingneurosci/","section":"publication","summary":"Recent studies have highlighted the importance of regular exercise on cognitive function in aging populations, with aerobic exercise and cardiovascular fitness having received the largest amount of research attention. However, the relationship between exercise mode and cognitive function underlying behavioral modification and neural activation remains unknown. The present study, therefore, sought to examine the associations between different exercise modes and the working memory (WM) aspect of executive function as well as its task-evoked brain activation in the late middle-aged population. Seventy late middle-aged adults were classified into open-skill, closed-skill, or irregular exercise groups based on their participation in exercise activities prior to the study and then performed a spatial working memory (SWM) task while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning. The results revealed that exercise groups, regardless of exercise modes, showed better SWM and physical fitness performance. Additionally, the open-skill group exhibited greater brain activation in the prefrontal lobe, anterior cingulate cortex/supplementary motor area (ACC/SMA), and hippocampus than those in the closed-skill group, suggesting a mode-sensitive compensatory mechanism in late middle-aged adults. These findings indicate that exercise promotes cognitive health, improves WM, and enhances neurocognitive scaffolding in late middle-aged adults and further suggest that various exercise modes can effectively modulate frontal and hippocampal function in the face of age-related neurocognitive declines, implications that may inform the development of exercise programs for the elderly.","tags":["open-skill exercise","closed-skill exercise","executive control","aging","cognition"],"title":"Effects of exercise modes on neural processing of working memory in late middle-aged adults: An fMRI study","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1501951500,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1501951500,"objectID":"a8c76de6fd86597e2597df6556d3efa5","permalink":"https://yapingchen21.github.io/presentation/2017_icon/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/presentation/2017_icon/","section":"presentation","summary":"International Conference for Cognitive Neuroscience (ICON), Amsterdam, Netherlands","tags":[],"title":"Poster - The influences of selection history on working memory: An EEG study","type":"presentation"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

Recently, kinematic analysis systems have been used to assess rehabilitative outcomes in stroke patients. Kinematic systems, however, are not compatible with tele-assessment. The objective of our study was to develop a tele-assessment system for acquiring kinematic data of forward reaching movements in stroke patients, with an emphasis on cost-effectiveness, portability, and ease of use.Materials and Methods:We selected four healthy control participants and eight hemiplegic stroke patients for our study. The stroke patients were classified as Brunnstrom stage III, stage IV, or stage V. Our tele-assessment system used two three-axes accelerometers, a potentiometer, a multifunctional data acquisition card, and two computers. A standardized kinematic system was applied simultaneously to validate the measurements recorded by our tele-assessment system during five repetitions of forward reaching movements.Results:The correlation coefficients of the reaching displacement, velocity, and acceleration measurements obtained using our tele-assessment system and the standardized kinematic system were 0.956, 0.896, and 0.727, respectively. Differences in the maximum reaching distance and the maximum reaching velocity of forward reaching movements were observed among the study groups. There were no significant differences in the time required to complete the testing session among the study groups.Conclusions:Our tele-assessment system is valid for the evaluation of upper-extremity reaching ability in stroke patients. Further research is needed to investigate the feasibility of the use of the tele-assessment system in patients' homes.","tags":["tele-assessment","stroke","upper extremity function"],"title":"Low-cost tele-assessment system for home-based evaluation of reaching ability following stroke","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1368204300,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1368204300,"objectID":"2a8df7d617fc091450d2b5deafd9651f","permalink":"https://yapingchen21.github.io/presentation/2013_vss/","publishdate":"2005-02-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/presentation/2013_vss/","section":"presentation","summary":"Annual Meeting of Vision Science Society (VSS), Naples, Florida, USA","tags":[],"title":"Poster - Atypical visio-temporal processing in Schizophrenia and Autism Spectrum Disorders revealed by the continuous wagon wheel illusion","type":"presentation"}]
